            \noindent Magnetic monopoles have been theoretically predicted to exist as elementary particles yet have not been observed in free space to this day. However, in a group of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials known as spin ice, emergent quasi-particles have been observed which behave as magnetic monopoles. Performing simulations on a kagome lattice, a corner-shared triangular lattice using a Monte-Carlo procedure, I was able to obtain evidence for these quasi-particles and their associated strings which were intrinsic properties of the lattice. Furthermore, it was found that these `monopoles/anti-monopoles' interact via a magnetic analogy to the coulomb interaction with same charges repelling each other and opposite charges attracting one another and annihilating.
